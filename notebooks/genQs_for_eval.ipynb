       " 'content': 'DETECTING LEAD-LAGRELATIONSHIPS IN STOCK RETURNS AND PORTFOLIO STRATEGIES∗ Álvaro Cartea†‡Mihai Cucuringu∗§†¶Qi Jin∗‡∥ June 9, 2024 Click here for the most recent version ABSTRACT We propose a method to detect linear and nonlinear lead-lag relationships in stock returns. Our approach uses pairwise Lévy-area and cross-correlation of returns to rank the assets from leaders to followers. We use the rankings to construct a portfolio that longs or shorts the followers based on the previous returns of the leaders, and the stocks are ranked every time the portfolio is rebalanced. The portfolio also takes an offsetting position on the SPY ETF so that the initial value of the portfolio is zero. Our data spans from 1963 to 2022, and we use an average of over 500 stocks to construct portfolios for each trading day. The annualized returns of our lead-lag portfolios are over 20 %, and the returns outperform all lead-lag benchmarks in the literature. There is little overlap between the leaders and the followers we find and those that are reported in previous studies based on market capitalization, volume traded, and intra-industry relationships. Our findings support the slow information diffusion hypothesis; i.e., portfolios rebalanced once a day consistently outperform the bidiurnal, weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly, and monthly rebalanced portfolios.

This relationship between stock prices is often referred to as a lead-lag relationship. Detecting lead-lag relationships among a large set of stocks is not straightforward. The extant literature uses ad-hoc methods to select leaders and followers, and employs these two sets of stocks in investment strategies to evaluate the economic significance of the lead-lag relationship. For example, Lo and MacKinlay (1990) assume that large market capitalization stocks lead small market capitalization stocks. They build equal-weighted portfolios within each quantile of market capitalizations and use the cross-autocorrelation between the five portfolios to evaluate the trading performance of the lead-lag relationship. Empirical evidence suggests that firm size (Lo and MacKinlay (1990)), trading volume (Chordia and Swaminathan (2000)), institutional ownership (Badrinath et al. (1995)), and other firm characteristics contribute to the lead-lag identity of a stock. Empirically, however, many lead-lag relationships change over time and often cannot be explained by sorting stocks on a single firm characteristic.7This observation motivates that it is necessary to detect, instead of assume and then verify, lead-lag relationships. Our objective is to find lead-lag relationships without explicitly assuming a link between firm characteristics and lead-lag relationships; instead, we develop a data-driven method that employs stock returns to identify leaders and followers, and we show that the lead-lag relationships we find are economically significant. We achieve this in three steps. First, we design an algorithm that identifies the direction and strength of the lead-lag relationship between the returns of two stocks. Second, we propose a framework that uses state-of-the-art algorithms to rank stocks from leaders to followers based on the pairwise relationships. Third, we construct a zero-cost portfolio to assess the returns predictability of the leaders over the followers, and we measure the economic significance of the portfolio’s performance. Specifically, in the first step we design a method to score the lead-lag relationship between pairs of assets. The sign of the score indicates which of the two assets is more likely the leader, and the magnitude of the score quantifies the strength of the lead-lag relationship.',\n",
